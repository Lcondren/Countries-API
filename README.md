The design of the programme I used three classes:

1.	The Server Class – to set up the Server and the port to be used for when clients are looking to join 
2.	The Client Class -  to set up clients that can access the server, let them type in their names, allow them to write messages on the server, by using Threads with Client Handler
3.	The ClientHandler Class – to set up the threads, allow the messages from the clients be read in the server by using a BufferedReader
